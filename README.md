# Personal Portfolio Project


This project was an assignment to understand how to work with flexbox and grid. I have also used some simple animations to make the page look more interactive.

## What I learned

- How to use flexbox to create flexible layouts
- How to use grid to create grid-based layouts
- How to use CSS transitions and transforms to create animations

## How to run the project

- Download or clone the project files from this repository
- Open the index.html file in your browser
- Enjoy the responsive and animated web page
